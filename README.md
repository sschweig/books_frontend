# My Library
This is a demonstration of Google's Books API. This is a simple frontend designed
to allow a user to interact with the API's search functionality and browse for 
books by keyword.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design
The app is designed to serve as a browser for the Google Books API catalogue. As
such the available functionaly is restricted to the ability to execute a query, 
and browse the results.

## TODO
Clean up Tailwind
Implement pop up on mouseover for in depth view
Advanced query filters
Style options
